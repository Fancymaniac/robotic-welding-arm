# ü§ñ Robotic Welding Arm Simulation

This repository presents a comprehensive simulation of a **6-DOF robotic manipulator** for motorcycle headstock welding. Developed using MATLAB and Simulink, the robot is designed to follow a weld path within a constrained workspace, navigating through obstacles while ensuring smooth joint trajectories.
